# Bayes Resources
Plethora of knowledge (papers, books, videos etc) in my journey to learn bayesian methods in machine learning

## Books
[ Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective - Kevin P. Murphy ](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf) (A good start to learn probabilistic machine learning, the first two introductory chapters are pretty good for starter)

## Tutorials and Course Notes
[Course Notes forBayesian Models for Machine Learning - Columbia University Fall 2016](http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Teaching/E6720/BayesianModelsMachineLearning2016.pdf) (A must read note, the formula derivations are nice)

[Variational Inference: A Review for Statisticians - Blei et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf)

[Matrix Cook Book](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf) (many usefull facts on linear algebra and beyond)

## Bayesian Deep Learning
### Monte Carlo Dropout Related
[Uncertainty in Deep Learning (PhD Thesis) - Yarin Gal](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_2248.html)

[Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation:Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning - Yarin Gal](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf)

note that this method is little controversial following [Ian Osband](https://iosband.github.io/) note on NIPS 2016 workshop.

### Other Methods 

## Gaussian Process and Bayesian Optimization
[Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning - Carl Edward Rasmussen](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/). short intro : [link](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hutter/EARG.shtml/earg/papers05/rasmussen_gps_in_ml.pdf). video lecture : [link](http://videolectures.net/mlss03_rasmussen_gp/)

[Sparse GP using pseudo Input - Snelson & Ghahramani](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~snelson/SPGP_up.pdf)

[A Tutorial on Bayesian OptimizationPeter - I. Frazier](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02811.pdf)

## Online Courses

[Bayesian Method for Machine Learning - National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning) (Comprehensive, compact and intuitive course on bayesian method for machine learning, this is good start for getting basic intuition on bayesian methods)
