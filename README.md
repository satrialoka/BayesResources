# Bayes Resources
Plethora of knowledge (papers, books, videos etc) in my journey to learn bayesian methods in machine learning

## Books
[ Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective - Kevin P. Murphy ](https://doc.lagout.org/science/Artificial%20Intelligence/Machine%20learning/Machine%20Learning_%20A%20Probabilistic%20Perspective%20%5BMurphy%202012-08-24%5D.pdf) (A good start to learn probabilistic machine learning, the first two introductory chapters are pretty good for starter)

## Tutorials

## Bayesian Deep Learning
[Uncertainty in Deep Learning (PhD Thesis) - Yarin Gal](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_2248.html)

## Online Courses

[Bayesian Method for Machine Learning - National Research University Higher School of Economics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/bayesian-methods-in-machine-learning) (Comprehensive, compact and intuitive course on bayesian method for machine learning, this is good start for getting basic intuition on bayesian methods)
